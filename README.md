## The Odin Project - Web Development 101

<b> Project: HTML/CSS </b>

This was one of their first assigned projects in The Odin Project. Recreating Google's homepage to demonstrate my knowledge/abilities with HTML and CSS. I used the Google doodle for Mexico's Independence day. The top navigation bar links to their respective locations but for the footer links, I felt it would be overkill.
